Hi Carlos and Peter,
 
I?ve uploaded the most recent data I collected for the LIFT project to Dropbox. Here is the web link:

For the experiment, I changed the defocus value between the exposures by moving the WFS camera from -0.5 mm to 0.5 mm (with respect to the optimal focus) in steps of 0.05 mm.
 
The relevant parameters are:
-          Instrument: NIRC2 imager
-          Plate scale: 9.942 mas/pixel
-          Optical filter: Br Gamma (effective wavelength is 2.1686 um.)
-          Probe aberration: 200 nm zero-degree astigmatism
 
Thanks, Sam
